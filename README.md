# CSE331TypoSquating

This is the repository for the CSE 331 final project. We will be writing this modularly, meaning the web dashboard will execute the typogenerator,
then after the list is generated, it will execute many instances of webbrowse.py (numinstances based upon user Input to dashboard)

**BUGS**

typoGenerator.py

-We are not sure if typosquatting needs to take into account the www and .domain. (Easy Fix)

-Dots in the middle of URLs will not properly function. (Easy Fix)

webbrowse.py

-Need to specify where to save HTML bodies and screenshots (preferably by using command line args) (Easy Fix)
