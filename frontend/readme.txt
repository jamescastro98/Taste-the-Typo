This is made using typewriter-effect, grapheme-splitter and ran with parcel using some starter code I modified. Did basic HTML+CSS. 
Now we simply need to figure out how to merge the home template with this basic template (obviously not done).

To run, download npm if you don't have it.
npm install
npm run build
parcel index.html

it'll run on localhost:1234
